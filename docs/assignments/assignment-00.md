# IDM221 Assignment: Preparation

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Assignment: Preparation

This assignment focuses on getting setup and preparing for your final project.

### Registrations and Software

1. Register a domain and hosting plan with [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/philsinatra/).
    - Register for a standard, basic account.
    - You do not need any of the extra add-ons or additional features that cost additional money.
    - Be professional when choosing your domain name, you'll be using it for the remainder of your college career and probably beyond [Inappropriate Domain Name Examples](http://www.boredpanda.com/worst-domain-names/).

1. Register a [Github](https://github.com) user account.
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (or the text editor of your choice) on your personal development computer.
1. Register a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) user account.

### Content Preparation

1. Document Inspiration: select a minimum of three websites you can draw inspiration from and document your selections. Tell me why you like the site, or why you don't like the site. Is there a particular aspect of the site you like/don't? Something about how it looks? Something about how it works? Do not explain how the site works or what is on the site; instead explain why it is interesting to you.
1. Content Inventory: Content development is the key to success in web development. The number one reason students struggle with this class is because they do not have a clear definition of the content that will be included in the project. Document the following:
    - a minimum of four paragraphs about yourself
    - your professional resume
    - your professional contact information
    - professional logo (if you have one)
    - It would also be good to begin organizing pictures, graphics, videos, audio files and any other content or media you want to include in your project.

Document your inspiration and content inventory in a _markdown_ file. You can create a separate file for each, or group it all into a single file. The goal is to gather and organize the content, and have it structured using headings, paragraphs, lists etc. in proper _markdown_ syntax.

## Submitting the Assignment
